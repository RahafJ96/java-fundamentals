# java-fundamentals
In this repo you can check some java fundamentals for practicing Java starting from the basics.

## Basics
- In the `Basics folder` in `Main file` I have a class with 3 methods:
  - **Pluralize method:**  is for making the input word plural or keep it singular based on the number
  - **Clock Method:** To print the time every second and show how many Mega Hertz that program operates 
  - **FlipNHead method:** is for counting how many times we need to at least get the specified number of heads in a row

## Basic Library
- In the `basiclibrary` folder in `Library file` I have 4 methods:
    - `roll`
    - `containsDuplicates` 
    - `average` 
    - `lowestAvg`
  
  In the `test file` I had it to test every method in the code.

## Linter
- In the linter file I have 1 method:
- missingSemicolon: this method accept a path to a file and check every line for missing semicolons and ignore the line if:
   - `line ends With }`
   - `line ends With {`
   - `line contains if`
   - `line contains else`
   - `line starts With //`
   - `empty lines`
